The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonised System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column 3 or 4. Where, in some cases, the entry in the first column is preceded by an “ex”, this signifies that the rules in column 3 or 4 apply only to the part of that heading as described in column 2.

Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonised System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1.

Note 3:

<td width="5%">
3.1.
</td>
<td>
The provisions of Article 5 of this Annex, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in Chile.<br />
Example:<br />
An engine of heading 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 % of the ex-works price, is made from “other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging” of heading ex 7224.<br />
If this forging has been forged in the Community from a non-originating ingot, it has already acquired originating status by virtue of the rule for heading ex 7224 in the list. The forging can then count as originating in the value-calculation for the engine, regardless of whether it was produced in the same factory or in another factory in the Community. The value of the non-originating ingot is thus not taken into account when adding up the value of the non-originating materials used.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">
3.2.
</td>
<td>
The rule in the list represents the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">
3.3.
</td>
<td>
Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression “Manufacture from materials of any heading”, then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.<br />
However, the expression “Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ...” or “Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product” means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column 2 of the list.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">
3.4.
</td>
<td>
When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.<br />
Example:<br />
The rule for fabrics of headings 5208 to 5212 provides that natural fibres may be used and that chemical materials, among other materials, may also be used. This does not mean that both have to be used; it is possible to use one or the other, or both.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">
3.5.
</td>
<td>
Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition obviously does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy the rule. (See also Note 6.2 below in relation to textiles).<br />
Example:<br />
The rule for prepared foods of heading 1904, which specifically excludes the use of cereals and their derivatives, does not prevent the use of mineral salts, chemicals and other additives which are not products from cereals.<br />
However, this does not apply to products which, although they cannot be manufactured from the particular materials specified in the list, can be produced from a material of the same nature at an earlier stage of manufacture.<br />
Example:<br />
In the case of an article of apparel of ex Chapter 62 made from non-woven materials, if the use of only non-originating yarn is allowed for this class of article, it is not possible to start from non-woven cloth — even if non-woven cloths cannot normally be made from yarn. In such cases, the starting material would normally be at the stage before yarn — that is, the fibre stage.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="5%">
3.6.
</td>
<td>
Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.

However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.<br />
The following are the basic textile materials:<br />
— silk,<br />

— coarse animal hair,<br />
— fine animal hair,<br />
— horsehair,<br />
— cotton,<br />
— paper-making materials and paper,<br />

— artificial man-made filaments,<br />
— current-conducting filaments,<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),<br />
— synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),<br />
— other synthetic man-made staple fibres,<br />
— artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,<br />
— other artificial man-made staple fibres,<br />
— yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,<br />
— yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,<br />
— products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,<br />
— other products of heading 5605.<br />
Example:<br />
A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.<br />
Example:<br />
A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.<br />
Example:<br />
Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.<br />
Example:<br />
If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.

Example:<br />
If a rule in the list provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63.
