For the purposes of this note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together.\r\nIf no single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\r\n\r\n5.Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.\r\n\r\n6.In headings 3901 to 3914, the expression \u2018primary forms\u2019 applies only to the following forms:\r\n\r\n(a) liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;\r\n\r\n(b) blocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms.\r\n\r\n7.Heading 3915 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings 3901 to 3914).\r\n\r\n8.For the purposes of heading 3917, the expression \u2018tubes, pipes and hoses\u2019 means hollow products, whether semi-manufactured or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last mentioned, those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed one-and-a-half times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes.\r\n\r\n9.For the purposes of heading 3918, the expression \u2018wall or ceiling coverings of plastics\u2019 applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.\r\n\r\n10.In headings 3920 and 3921, the expression \u2018plates, sheets, film, foil and strip\u2019 applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use).\r\n\r\n11.Heading 3925 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of sub-chapter II:\r\n\r\n(a) reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres;\r\n\r\n(b) structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs;\r\n\r\n(c) gutters and fittings therefor;\r\n\r\n(d) doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors;\r\n\r\n(e) balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers;\r\n\r\n(f) shutters, blinds (including venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof;\r\n\r\n(g) large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;\r\n\r\n(h) ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and\r\n\r\n(ij) fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n1.Within any one heading of this chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following provisions:\r\n\r\n(a) where there is a subheading named \u2018Other\u2019 in the same series:\r\n\r\n(1) the designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix \u2018poly\u2019 (for example, polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer content;\r\n\r\n(2) the copolymers named in subheadings 3901 30, 3901 40, 3903 20, 3903 30 and 3904 30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer content;\r\n\r\n(3) chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named \u2018Other\u2019, provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading;\r\n\r\n(4) polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared;\r\n\r\n  (b) where there is no subheading named \u2018Other\u2019 in the same series:\r\n\r\n(1) polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared;\r\n\r\n(2) chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.\r\n\r\nPolymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions.\r\n\r\n2.For the purposes of subheading 3920 43, the term \u2018plasticisers\u2019 includes secondary plasticisers.\r\n\r\n## Additional note ##\r\n\r\n1.

For the purposes of headings 6103 and 6104:\r\n  * (a) the term 'suit' means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical fabric and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket; and\r\n    * \\- one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.\r\n  * All of the components of a 'suit' must be of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the same style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.\r\n  * If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.\r\n  * The term 'suit' includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:\r\n    * \\- morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers;\r\n    * \\- evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;\r\n    * \\- dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt-front), but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels.\r\n  * (b) The term 'ensemble' means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading 6107, 6108 or 6109), composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of pullovers which may form a second upper garment in the sole context of twin sets, and of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and\r\n    * \\- one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.\r\n  * All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size. The term 'ensemble' does not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading 6112.\r\n* 4\\. Headings 6105 and 6106 do not cover garments with pockets below the waist, with a ribbed waistband or other means of tightening at the bottom of the garment, or garments having an average of less than 10 stitches per linear centimetre in each direction counted on an area measuring at least 10cm x 10cm. Heading 6105 does not cover sleeveless garments.\r\n* 5\\. Heading 6109 does not cover garments with a drawstring, ribbed waistband or other means of tightening at the bottom of the garment.\r\n* 6\\. For the purposes of heading 6111:\r\n  * (a) the expression 'babies garments and clothing accessories' means articles for young children of a body height not exceeding 86cm;\r\n  * (b) articles which are prima facie, classifiable both in heading 6111 and in other headings of this Chapter are to be classified in heading 6111.\r\n* 7\\. For the purposes of heading 6112 'ski suits' means garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance and texture, are identifiable as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross country or alpine). They consist of either:\r\n  * (a) a 'ski overall', that is, a one piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to sleeves and a collar, the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or\r\n  * (b) a 'ski ensemble', that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one garment such as an anorak, windcheater, wind jacket or similar article, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly with a waistcoat in addition, and\r\n    * \\- one pair of trousers, whether or not extending above waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.\r\n  * The 'ski ensemble' may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.\r\n  * All the components of a 'ski ensemble' must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or not of the same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.\r\n* 8\\. Garments which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 6113 and in other headings of this Chapter, excluding heading 6111, are to be classified in heading 6113.\r\n* 9\\. Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure at the front shall be regarded as men's or boys' garments, and those designed for right over left closure at the front as women's or girls' garments. These provisions do not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one or other of the sexes.\r\n  * Garments which cannot be identified as either men's or boys' garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified in the headings covering women's or girls' garments.\r\n* 10\\. Articles of this chapter may be made of metal thread.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. For the application of note 3 (b) to this chapter, the components of an ensemble must be made up entirely in a single identical fabric, subject to compliance with the other conditions laid down in the said note.\r\n* For this purpose:\r\n  * \\- the fabric used can be unbleached, bleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed.\r\n  * \\- a pullover or waistcoat with ribbing is to be considered as a component of an ensemble, even if there is no ribbing on the component intended to cover the lower part of the body, provided that the ribbing is not sewn on but produced directly by the knitting process.\r\n* Sets of garments are not regarded as ensembles when their components are made up in different fabrics, even if the difference is due only to their respective colours.\r\n* All the components of an ensemble must be presented together for retail sale as a single unit. Individual wrapping or separate labelling of each component of such a single unit does not influence its classification as an ensemble.\r\n* 2\\. For the purposes of heading 6109, the terms 'singlets' and 'other vests' include garments, even if of a fancy design, worn next to the body, without collar, with or without sleeves, including those with shoulder straps.\r\n* These garments, which are intended to cover the upper part of the body, often possess many characteristics in common with those of T-shirts or with more traditional kinds of singlets and other vests of heading 6109.\r\n* 3\\. Heading 6111 and subheadings 6116 10 20 and 6116 10 80 cover gloves, mittens and mitts, impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber, even if they are:\r\n  * \\- made up from knitted or crocheted textile fabrics impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber of headings 5903 or 5906\r\n  * \\- or made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered knitted or crocheted textile fabrics and subsequently impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber.\r\n* Where knitted or crocheted textile fabrics serve only as reinforcement, gloves, mittens or mitts impregnated, coated or covered with cellular plastics or cellular rubber belong in Chapters 39 or 40, even if they are made up from unimpregnated, uncoated or uncovered knitted or crocheted textile fabrics and subsequently impregnated, coated or covered with cellular plastics or cellular rubber (note 2(a)(5) and note 4 last paragraph to Chapter 59).", "section_id": 11}, "relationships": {"section": {"data":

For the purposes of headings 6203 and 6204:\r\n  * (a) the term 'suit' means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical fabric and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket; and\r\n    * \\- one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.\r\n* All of the components of a 'suit' must be of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the same style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.\r\n* If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.\r\n* The term 'suit' includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:\r\n    * \\- morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers;\r\n    * \\- evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;\r\n    * \\- dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels.\r\n  * (b) the term 'ensemble' means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading 6207 or 6208) composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:\r\n    * \\- one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and\r\n    * \\- one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.\r\n* All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.

Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure at the front shall be regarded as men's or boys' garments, and those designed for right over left closure at the front as women's or girls' garments. These provisions do not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one or other of the sexes.\r\nGarments which cannot be identified as either men's or boys' garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified in the headings covering women's or girls' garments.\r\n* 9\\.

For the application note 3 (b) of this chapter, the components of an ensemble must be made up entirely in a single identical fabric, subject to compliance with the other conditions laid down in the said note.\r\n* For this purpose, the fabric used can be unbleached, bleached, dyed, of yarns of different colours or printed.\r\n* Sets of garments are not regarded as ensembles when their components are made up in different fabrics, even if the difference is due only to their respective colours.\r\n* All the components of an ensemble must be presented together for retail sale as a single unit. Individual wrapping or separate labelling of each component of such a single unit does not influence its classification as an ensemble.\r\n* 2\\. Headings 6209 and 6216 cover gloves, mittens and mitts, impregnated, coated or covered with plastics or rubber, even if they are:\r\n  * \\- made up from textile fabrics (other than knitted or
