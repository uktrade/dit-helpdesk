Their presence can be determined using methods set out in Annexes V and X to that Regulation.\r\nHeadings 1509 and 1510 do not cover chemically altered olive oil (in particular re-esterified olive oil) and mixtures of olive oil with other oils. The presence of re-esterified olive oil is ascertained using the method set out in Annex VII to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.\r\n\r\nB. Subheading 1509 10 covers only the olive oils defined in points 1, 2 and 3 below, obtained solely by mechanical or other physical means under conditions which do not lead to the modification of the oil, and which have not undergone any treatment other than washing, decantation, centrifugation or filtration. Olive oils obtained using solvents, chemical or biochemical reagents, or re-esterification processes, as well as any mixtures with oils of other kinds, are excluded from this subheading.\r\n\r\n1.

Accordingly, account is to be taken also of the footnotes of Annex I to the Regulation.\r\n\r\n5.Food preparations made from products of Chapter 15 presented in measured doses, such as capsules, tablets, pastilles and pills, intended for use as food supplements, are excluded from this Chapter. The essential character of a food supplement is not only given by its ingredients, but also by its specific form of presentation revealing its function as a food supplement, since it determines the dosage, the way in which it is absorbed and the place where it is supposed to become active.

Such fabric may have been treated with a colourless dressing or a fugitive dye.\r\n  * (e) _'Bleached woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which:\r\n    * (1) has been bleached or, unless the context otherwise requires, dyed white or treated with a white dressing, in the piece;\r\n    * (2) consists of bleached yarn; or\r\n    * (3) consists of unbleached and bleached yarn.\r\n  * (f) _'Dyed woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which:\r\n    * (1) is dyed a single uniform colour other than white (unless the context otherwise requires) or has been treated with a coloured finish other than white (unless the context otherwise requires), in the piece; or\r\n    * (2) consists of coloured yarn of a single uniform colour.\r\n  * (g) _'Woven fabric of yarns of different colours'_:\r\n  * woven fabric (other than printed woven fabric) which:\r\n    * (1) consists of yarns of different colours or yarns of different shades of the same colour (other than the natural colour of the constituent fibres);\r\n    * (2) consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn; or\r\n    * (3) consists of marl or mixture yarns.\r\n* (In all cases, the yarn used in selvedges and piece ends is not taken into consideration).\r\n  * (h) _'Printed woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which has been printed in the piece, whether or not made from yarns of different colours.\r\n* (The following are also regarded as printed woven fabrics: woven fabrics bearing designs made, for example, with a brush or spray gun, by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by the batik process.)\r\n* The process of mercerisation does not affect the classification of yarns or fabrics within the above categories.\r\n* The definitions at (d) to (h) above apply, mutatis mutandis, to knitted or crocheted fabrics.\r\n  * (ij) _'Plain weave'_:\r\n  * a fabric construction in which each yarn of the weft passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the warp and each yarn of the warp passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the weft.\r\n* 2\\. (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly of that textile material which would be selected under note 2 to this section for the classification of a product of Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 5809 consisting of the same textile materials.\r\n* (B) For the application of this rule:\r\n  * (a) where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under interpretative rule 3 shall be taken into account;\r\n  * (b) in the case of textile products consisting of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface, no account shall be taken of the ground fabric;\r\n  * (c) in the case of embroidery of heading 5810 and goods thereof, only the ground fabric shall be taken into account. However, embroidery without visible ground and goods thereof, shall be classified with reference to the embroidering threads alone."}, "relationships": {"chapters": {"data": [{"id": "40856", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "40952", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "41064", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "41605", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "41701", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "41901", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "42190", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "42333", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "42449", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "42601", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "42702", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "42796", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "43115", "type": "chapter"}, {"id": "43610", "type": "chapter"}]}}}, "included": [{"id": "40856", "type": "chapter", "attributes": {"goods_nomenclature_sid": 40856, "goods_nomenclature_item_id": "5000000000", "headings_from": "5001", "headings_to": "5007", "description": "SILK", "formatted_description": "Silk"}, "relationships": {"guides": {"data": [{"id": "23", "type": "guide"}]}}}, {"id": "40952", "type": "chapter", "attributes": {"goods_nomenclature_sid": 40952, "goods_nomenclature_item_id": "5100000000", "headings_from": "5101", "headings_to": "5113", "description": "WOOL, FINE OR COARSE ANIMAL HAIR;
