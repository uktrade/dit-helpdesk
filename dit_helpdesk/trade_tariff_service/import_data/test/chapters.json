For the purposes of this note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together.\r\nIf no single comonomer unit predominates, copolymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.\r\n\r\n5.Chemically modified polymers, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers.\r\n\r\n6.In headings 3901 to 3914, the expression \u2018primary forms\u2019 applies only to the following forms:\r\n\r\n(a) liquids and pastes, including dispersions (emulsions and suspensions) and solutions;\r\n\r\n(b) blocks of irregular shape, lumps, powders (including moulding powders), granules, flakes and similar bulk forms.\r\n\r\n7.Heading 3915 does not apply to waste, parings and scrap of a single thermoplastic material, transformed into primary forms (headings 3901 to 3914).\r\n\r\n8.For the purposes of heading 3917, the expression \u2018tubes, pipes and hoses\u2019 means hollow products, whether semi-manufactured or finished products, of a kind generally used for conveying, conducting or distributing gases or liquids (for example, ribbed garden hose, perforated tubes). This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, except for the last mentioned, those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval, rectangular (in which the length does not exceed one-and-a-half times the width) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes.\r\n\r\n9.For the purposes of heading 3918, the expression \u2018wall or ceiling coverings of plastics\u2019 applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastics fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on the face side) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.\r\n\r\n10.In headings 3920 and 3921, the expression \u2018plates, sheets, film, foil and strip\u2019 applies only to plates, sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of Chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become articles ready for use).\r\n\r\n11.Heading 3925 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the earlier headings of sub-chapter II:\r\n\r\n(a) reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 300 litres;\r\n\r\n(b) structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceilings or roofs;\r\n\r\n(c) gutters and fittings therefor;\r\n\r\n(d) doors, windows and their frames and thresholds for doors;\r\n\r\n(e) balconies, balustrades, fencing, gates and similar barriers;\r\n\r\n(f) shutters, blinds (including venetian blinds) and similar articles and parts and fittings thereof;\r\n\r\n(g) large-scale shelving for assembly and permanent installation, for example, in shops, workshops, warehouses;\r\n\r\n(h) ornamental architectural features, for example, flutings, cupolas, dovecotes; and\r\n\r\n(ij) fittings and mountings intended for permanent installation in or on doors, windows, staircases, walls or other parts of buildings, for example, knobs, handles, hooks, brackets, towel rails, switch-plates and other protective plates.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n1.Within any one heading of this chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following provisions:\r\n\r\n(a) where there is a subheading named \u2018Other\u2019 in the same series:\r\n\r\n(1) the designation in a subheading of a polymer by the prefix \u2018poly\u2019 (for example, polyethylene and polyamide-6,6) means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer content;\r\n\r\n(2) the copolymers named in subheadings 3901 30, 3901 40, 3903 20, 3903 30 and 3904 30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95 % or more by weight of the total polymer content;\r\n\r\n(3) chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named \u2018Other\u2019, provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading;\r\n\r\n(4) polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared;\r\n\r\n  (b) where there is no subheading named \u2018Other\u2019 in the same series:\r\n\r\n(1) polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared;\r\n\r\n(2) chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to the unmodified polymer.\r\n\r\nPolymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions.\r\n\r\n2.For the purposes of subheading 3920 43, the term \u2018plasticisers\u2019 includes secondary plasticisers.\r\n\r\n## Additional note ##\r\n\r\n1.

The woven fabrics of Chapters 50 to 55 include fabrics consisting of layers of parallel textile yarns superimposed on each other at acute or right angles. These layers are bonded at the intersections of the yarns by an adhesive or by thermal bonding.\r\n* 10\\. Elastic products consisting of textile materials combined with rubber threads are classified in this section.\r\n* 11. For the purposes of this section, the expression 'impregnated' includes 'dipped'.\r\n* 12\\. For the purposes of this section, the expression 'polyamides' includes 'aramids.'\r\n* 13\\. For the purposes of this section and, where applicable, throughout the nomenclature, the expression 'elastomeric yarn' means filament yarn, including monofilament, of synthetic textile material, other than textured yarn, which does not break on being extended to three times its original length and which returns, after being extended to twice its original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater than one and a half times its original length.\r\n* 14\\. Unless the context otherwise requires, textile garments of different headings are to be classified in their own headings, even if put up in sets for retail sale. For the purposes of this note, the expression 'textile garments' means garments of headings 6101 to 6114 and headings 6201 to 6211.\r\n\r\n## Subheading notes ##\r\n\r\n* 1\\. In this section and, where applicable, throughout the nomenclature, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:\r\n  * (a) _'Unbleached yarn'_: \r\n  * yarn which:\r\n    * (1) has the natural colour of its constituent fibres and has not been bleached, dyed (whether or not in the mass) or printed; or\r\n    * (2) is of indeterminate colour (grey yarn), manufactured from garnetted stock.\r\n  * Such yarn may have been treated with a colourless dressing or fugitive dye (which disappears after simple washing with soap) and, in the case of man-made fibres, treated in the mass with delustring agents (for example, titanium dioxide).\r\n  * (b) _'Bleached yarn'_:\r\n  * yarn which:\r\n    * (1) has undergone a bleaching process, is made of bleached fibres or, unless the context otherwise requires, has been dyed white (whether or not in the mass) or treated with a white dressing;\r\n    * (2) consists of a mixture of unbleached and bleached fibres; or\r\n    * (3) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached and bleached yarns.\r\n  * (c) _'Coloured (dyed or printed) yarn'_:\r\n  * yarn which:\r\n    * (1) is dyed (whether or not in the mass) other than white or in a fugitive colour, or printed, or made from dyed or printed fibres;\r\n    * (2) consists of a mixture of dyed fibres of different colours or of a mixture of unbleached or bleached fibres with coloured fibres (marl or mixture yarns), or is printed in one or more colours at intervals to give the impression of dots;\r\n    * (3) is obtained from slivers or rovings which have been printed; or\r\n    * (4) is multiple (folded) or cabled and consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn.\r\n* The above definitions also apply, mutatis mutandis, to monofilament and to strip or the like of Chapter 54.\r\n  * (d) _'Unbleached woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric made from unbleached yarn and which has not been bleached, dyed or printed. Such fabric may have been treated with a colourless dressing or a fugitive dye.\r\n  * (e) _'Bleached woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which:\r\n    * (1) has been bleached or, unless the context otherwise requires, dyed white or treated with a white dressing, in the piece;\r\n    * (2) consists of bleached yarn; or\r\n    * (3) consists of unbleached and bleached yarn.\r\n  * (f) _'Dyed woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which:\r\n    * (1) is dyed a single uniform colour other than white (unless the context otherwise requires) or has been treated with a coloured finish other than white (unless the context otherwise requires), in the piece; or\r\n    * (2) consists of coloured yarn of a single uniform colour.\r\n  * (g) _'Woven fabric of yarns of different colours'_:\r\n  * woven fabric (other than printed woven fabric) which:\r\n    * (1) consists of yarns of different colours or yarns of different shades of the same colour (other than the natural colour of the constituent fibres);\r\n    * (2) consists of unbleached or bleached yarn and coloured yarn; or\r\n    * (3) consists of marl or mixture yarns.\r\n* (In all cases, the yarn used in selvedges and piece ends is not taken into consideration).\r\n  * (h) _'Printed woven fabric'_:\r\n  * Woven fabric which has been printed in the piece, whether or not made from yarns of different colours.\r\n* (The following are also regarded as printed woven fabrics: woven fabrics bearing designs made, for example, with a brush or spray gun, by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by the batik process.)\r\n* The process of mercerisation does not affect the classification of yarns or fabrics within the above categories.\r\n* The definitions at (d) to (h) above apply, mutatis mutandis, to knitted or crocheted fabrics.\r\n  * (ij) _'Plain weave'_:\r\n  * a fabric construction in which each yarn of the weft passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the warp and each yarn of the warp passes alternately over and under successive yarns of the weft.\r\n* 2\\. (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly of that textile material which would be selected under note 2 to this section for the classification of a product of Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 5809 consisting of the same textile materials.\r\n* (B) For the application of this rule:\r\n  * (a) where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under interpretative rule 3 shall be taken into account;\r\n  * (b) in the case of textile products consisting of a ground fabric and a pile or looped surface, no account shall be taken of the ground fabric;\r\n  * (c) in the case of embroidery of heading 5810 and goods thereof, only the ground fabric shall be taken into account. However, embroidery without visible ground and goods thereof, shall be classified with reference to the embroidering threads alone."}}]}]
