            The duty paid on your goods is based on the import value. This will normally be the sales cost of your goods plus freight, insurance and any other costs or expenses when delivering your goods to the port or other import location. You do not need to include transport costs within the UK, buying commission, UK selling commission, or duties and taxes chargeable in the UK.
