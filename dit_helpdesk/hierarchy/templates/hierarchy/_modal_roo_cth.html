    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-2">Change in tariff heading (CTH)</h3>
    <p>
        When a non-originating material is used to produce another finished product, the 4-digit level of its original commodity code will need to change once itâ€™s incorporated into the final product. This is referred to as a change in tariff heading.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example:
    </p>
    <p>
        Thin copper wire with a diameter below 6mm comes under the commodity code 740819.
    </p>
    <p>
        A UK manufacturer makes wire from copper sheets sourced from outside the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 6-digit commodity code for the copper sheets is 74<strong>09</strong>19
    </p>
    <p>
        The 6-digit commodity code for the thin UK wire is 74<strong>08</strong>19
    </p>
    <p>
        The commodity code changes at the 4-digit level when the copper sheets become wire. This means it has gone through a change in tariff heading.
