            How to use the rules of origin table

    <div class="govuk-details__text govuk-!-padding-bottom-0 govuk-!-font-size-16">
        <p>The rules of origin table contains:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                the product classification heading ('HS heading') or chapter number (column 1)
            </li>
            <li>
                a description of the product (column 2)
            </li>
            <li>
                a description of how non-originating materials must be worked or processed to get country of origin status (column 3)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In some cases there may be 2 columns (columns 3 and 4) that describe how non-originating materials must be worked or processed.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each row:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                check column 1 to find the product classification heading or chapter number for the product being exported
            </li>
            <li>
                check column 2 to find the description that applies to the product
            </li>
            <li>
                check column 3 (and 4 if present) to see how the product must be worked or processed to gain country of origin status
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Unless preceded by ‘ex’, the rules in column 3 (or 4 if present) apply to all products that come under the headings and chapters in column 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the heading in column 1 starts with ‘ex’, the rules in column 3 (and 4 if present) will only apply to the product as described in column 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there are 2 columns that describe how non-originating materials must be worked or processed (if columns 3 and 4 are present), you can apply either rule.
        </p>
