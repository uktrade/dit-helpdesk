    The UK has signed a trade agreement with Chile. The UK's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff, or third country duty (see table below), will apply if the conditions for preferential access are not met.

    This agreement largely maintains the previous EU trade agreement, including in most instances on duties. However, in some cases, the non-preferential applied rates may in fact be lower because of changes in the UKâ€™s MFN tariff schedule.
