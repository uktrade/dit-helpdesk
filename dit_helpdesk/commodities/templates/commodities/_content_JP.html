<p>
    The UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) was signed on 23 October 2020.
</p>
<p>
    Tariff rates for bilateral trade in goods between the UK and Japan will for the vast majority of products remain the same in CEPA.
</p>
<p>
    Some <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/look-up-import-tariffs-1-january-2021">preferential rates and commodity codes from 1 January 2021</a> are now available. More will be added towards the end of the year, and some information may change.
</p>
<p>
    In some cases, the non-preferential applied rates are lower because of changes in the UKâ€™s Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff schedule. The <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-tariffs-from-1-january-2021">UK Global Tariff</a> was published in May 2020 and sets out the UK's MFN tariff from 1 January 2021, which will apply if the conditions for preferential access are not met. The current figures for this product are shown below.
