    The UK has reached a trade agreement with the EU which is expected to take effect from 1 January 2021. This establishes zero tariffs or quotas on trade between the UK and EU, where goods meet the relevant rules of origin. <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union/summary-explainer">Find out more about the agreement</a>.

  This agreement also provides for full bilateral cumulation, allowing EU inputs and processing to be counted as UK input in UK products exported to the EU, and vice versa.

    The UK's MFN tariff will apply if the conditions for preferential access are not met.
